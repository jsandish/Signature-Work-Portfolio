# Signature Work Portfolio

## Project 1 - Heardle Game
This is a python game ran in the console inspired by "Heardle" where players are given increasingly longer snippets of music and they have to guess what the song is. This implementation utilizes the Spotify API to allow users to use their own music and select which playlist to play music from.

## Project 2 - Self-Percieved Quality of Life -- Data Analysis in R
This is a project that explores how Americans self rate their quality of life based on a variety of thier socioeconomic conditions. This project utilizes the language R to conduct data analysis and was a valuable experience to expand my knowledge when it came to scripting data analytics tools. Given my career path will likely be in data modeling and business operations, these were incredibly useful skills to learn.
